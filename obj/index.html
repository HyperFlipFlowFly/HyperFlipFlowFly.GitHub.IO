  I created a collection of small examples in Three.js to understand very quickly the purpose of some functions.
  You can visit the 'website' of the entire collection of pens here : http://mamboleoo.be/learnThree/

  You can also see the collection in CodePen
  https://codepen.io/collection/DrxLEd/

  Do not hesitate to comment if there is something wrong (I'm still learning)

  Thanks !
